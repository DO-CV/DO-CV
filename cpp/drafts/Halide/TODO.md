The Halide implementation of SIFT has been written with good confidence regarding the
implementation details:

Integration
-----------
- [x] Integrate the histogram localization
- [x] Integrate the peak localization
- [x] Integrate the peak refinement


Unit Tests
----------
- [x] Orientation histogram
- [x] Repeated box blur filters
- [x] Orientation peak localization
- [x] Orientation peak residual estimation
- [x] SIFT descriptor
      Compare with the initial CPU implementation.
